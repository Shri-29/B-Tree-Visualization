# B-Tree Visualization

This project is an interactive B-Tree visualization tool built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to insert and delete keys dynamically while seeing the tree structure update in real-time. The visualization helps learners and developers understand how B-Trees manage keys, handle node splits, and maintain balance, all with smooth animations and interactive feedback.

# Features
1) Dynamic Insertion and Deletion <br>
Insert or delete keys in the B-Tree with a simple interface. Each operation updates the tree instantly, showing how nodes split or merge and how keys move across the structure.

2) Animated Key Highlights <br>
Keys being inserted blink green, and keys being deleted blink red, providing clear visual feedback for each operation. This makes it easy to follow tree modifications step by step.

3) Clear Node and Edge Design<br>
Nodes are displayed as white rounded boxes with lavender-colored keys, and edges are curved lines connecting parents to children. This layout keeps the tree readable and visually appealing even for larger trees.

4) Responsive and Interactive Interface<br>
The canvas adjusts to screen size for a smooth experience on any device. Buttons include click animations.
